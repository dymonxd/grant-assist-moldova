# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** When a Moldovan entrepreneur enters their IDNO or describes their business idea, the platform matches them to eligible grants and generates polished, rubric-optimized application text in Romanian.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Data Layer and Company Profiles -- scraping foundation complete, server actions next

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Data Layer and Company Profiles)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase (02-01 complete)
Status: Phase 2 in progress -- scraping foundation done, ready for 02-02
Last activity: 2026-03-21 -- Completed 02-01-PLAN.md (Vitest, IDNO validation, scrapers, aggregate orchestrator)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 57%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 9min
- Total execution time: 0.6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Foundation | 3 | 30min | 10min |
| 2 - Data Layer | 1 | 5min | 5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (11min), 01-02 (4min), 01-03 (15min), 02-01 (5min)
- Trend: Accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase dependency-driven structure following research recommendation
- [Roadmap]: GEN requirements distributed across phases (GEN-01/02/03 in Phase 1, GEN-04 in Phase 4, GEN-05/06 in Phase 5)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Auth) can run parallel with Phase 3 (Matching); Phase 6 (Admin) can run parallel with Phase 5 (Writer)
- [01-01]: Used geist/font/sans local imports instead of Google Fonts for self-hosted fonts
- [01-01]: Kept shadcn/ui base-nova style with neutral base, added brand warm accent color in oklch
- [01-01]: analytics_daily_summary uses composite PK with COALESCE for nullable device_type
- [01-01]: Shared company_profiles readable via share_token without auth (RLS policy with expiry check)
- [Phase 01-02]: proxy.ts uses getClaims() for JWT validation instead of getSession() for stronger server-side signature verification
- [Phase 01-02]: proxy.ts creates Supabase client inline (not importing server.ts) because proxy needs request.cookies not next/headers cookies()
- [Phase 01-02]: Auth callback preserves redirect URL via next query parameter for post-signup navigation
- [Phase 01-03]: @react-pdf/renderer confirmed working on Vercel serverless -- server-side PDF generation is the strategy
- [Phase 01-03]: Default Helvetica font lacks Romanian ă/ș/ț glyphs -- Phase 5 must use Font.register() with Noto Sans or Geist Sans
- [Phase 01-03]: jspdf retained as emergency fallback if Font.register() cannot resolve diacritics
- [02-01]: IDNO test value corrected -- plan's 1003600070650 doesn't pass 7,3,1 checksum; used 1003600070656 (algorithm matches python-stdnum)
- [02-01]: OpenMoney scraper checks Content-Type for JSON first (Angular SPA), falls back to Cheerio HTML parsing
- [02-01]: Scraper CSS selectors are placeholder best-guesses -- need live-testing refinement

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [RESOLVED - Phase 1]: PDF generation strategy validated on Vercel. @react-pdf/renderer works, needs custom font for ă/ș/ț.
- [Phase 2]: Moldovan registry scraping reliability unknown until live testing
- [Phase 5]: Romanian AI output quality requires native speaker validation
- [Phase 5]: PDF diacritics fix (Font.register with Romanian font) must be implemented in EXPRT-02
