# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** When a Moldovan entrepreneur enters their IDNO or describes their business idea, the platform matches them to eligible grants and generates polished, rubric-optimized application text in Romanian.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Data Layer and Company Profiles -- grant browse page complete, 02-03 remaining

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Data Layer and Company Profiles)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (02-04 complete, 02-03 remaining)
Status: Phase 2 nearly complete -- grant browse page done, 02-03 (profile UI) is the last remaining plan
Last activity: 2026-03-21 -- Completed 02-04-PLAN.md (grant browse page with search/filters)

Progress: [█████████░] 86%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase dependency-driven structure following research recommendation
- [Roadmap]: GEN requirements distributed across phases (GEN-01/02/03 in Phase 1, GEN-04 in Phase 4, GEN-05/06 in Phase 5)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Auth) can run parallel with Phase 3 (Matching); Phase 6 (Admin) can run parallel with Phase 5 (Writer)
- [01-01]: Used geist/font/sans local imports instead of Google Fonts for self-hosted fonts
- [01-01]: Kept shadcn/ui base-nova style with neutral base, added brand warm accent color in oklch
- [01-01]: analytics_daily_summary uses composite PK with COALESCE for nullable device_type
- [01-01]: Shared company_profiles readable via share_token without auth (RLS policy with expiry check)
- [Phase 01-02]: proxy.ts uses getClaims() for JWT validation instead of getSession() for stronger server-side signature verification
- [Phase 01-02]: proxy.ts creates Supabase client inline (not importing server.ts) because proxy needs request.cookies not next/headers cookies()
- [Phase 01-02]: Auth callback preserves redirect URL via next query parameter for post-signup navigation
- [Phase 01-03]: @react-pdf/renderer confirmed working on Vercel serverless -- server-side PDF generation is the strategy
- [Phase 01-03]: Default Helvetica font lacks Romanian ă/ș/ț glyphs -- Phase 5 must use Font.register() with Noto Sans or Geist Sans
- [Phase 01-03]: jspdf retained as emergency fallback if Font.register() cannot resolve diacritics
- [02-01]: IDNO test value corrected -- plan's 1003600070650 doesn't pass 7,3,1 checksum; used 1003600070656 (algorithm matches python-stdnum)
- [02-01]: OpenMoney scraper checks Content-Type for JSON first (Angular SPA), falls back to Cheerio HTML parsing
- [02-01]: Scraper CSS selectors are placeholder best-guesses -- need live-testing refinement
- [02-02]: All server actions return {error: string} on failure (not exceptions) for safe Client Component consumption
- [02-02]: AI inference uses generateText + Output.object() with Zod schema (AI SDK v6 pattern, not deprecated generateObject)
- [02-02]: Romanian error messages in all server action validation paths
- [02-04]: Native HTML select for provider filter instead of shadcn Select (base-ui popover) -- simpler for URL-param-driven client component
- [02-04]: jsdom vitest environment per-file annotation to preserve node environment for non-UI tests
- [02-04]: Intl.NumberFormat/DateTimeFormat with 'ro-MD' locale for Romanian formatting
- [Phase 02]: Native HTML select for provider filter instead of shadcn Select (simpler for URL-param client component)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [RESOLVED - Phase 1]: PDF generation strategy validated on Vercel. @react-pdf/renderer works, needs custom font for ă/ș/ț.
- [Phase 2]: Moldovan registry scraping reliability unknown until live testing
- [Phase 5]: Romanian AI output quality requires native speaker validation
- [Phase 5]: PDF diacritics fix (Font.register with Romanian font) must be implemented in EXPRT-02
